## Editorial Secrets {#editorial-secrets}

The publishing system is not as rigid as it seems from the outside. Some know this and take advantage of it, which is a source of inequities in publishing. In order to share these “editorial secrets” with authors, Moin Syed wrote a great [blog post](https://getsyeducated.blogspot.com/2021/08/secrets-from-editors-portal-or.html). However, each journal will have different secrets, so you may consider making these explicit with authors in your submission guidelines. Some examples are outlined below.

### Appeals {#appeals}

The opportunity for authors to appeal rejected manuscripts provides an important step in ensuring that high-quality and credible science is not incorrectly rejected from publication. However, there are considerable variations in appeal processes among journals, with little evidence of any detailed, reproducible, or established appeal policies in operation ([Dambha-Miller & Jones, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1107)). You may consider adopting a formal appeals policy that authors are made aware of so that it can be applied universally.

### Cover Letters {#cover-letters}

How important is it to include a cover letter with a manuscript submission? It seems that [opinions differ](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/12/do-scientific-manuscripts-need-cover-letters/). [*Nature Immunology* considers cover letters](https://www.nature.com/articles/ni0208-107) to be “a dialog between the authors and the editors” where authors can “present their cases in a one- to two-page cover letter.” You may consider outlining in your submission guidelines what is expected in a cover letter, to ensure authors do not spend unnecessary time on a letter that is never read or, worse, have their manuscript rejected for not spending enough time on one.

This [infographic](https://6558cf98-9c4b-43ec-87d8-2c78ea81faf2.filesusr.com/ugd/75feef_fcb38cd631e04b6c8312f6886b5bacdd.pdf) is a helpful guide to authors. If this corresponds well to what your journal expects from a cover letter, you may consider sharing it with authors in your submission guidelines.

### Revise & Resubmit Workflows {#revise-and-resubmit-workflows}

Most journals leave it up to authors to determine what to include in a response to a revise & resubmit. Some authors write a very brief response, mostly referring reviewers back to the revised manuscript for a full re-review, whereas others write detailed breakdowns replying to each comment, copying excerpts from the revised manuscript with corresponding page numbers. While it is fine to leave this up to author discretion, if there is a preferred format you would like to receive the response in, you could consider creating a template for authors to fill out or at least share helpful guidelines. Moin Syed has outlined one workflow/format in a [blog post](http://getsyeducated.blogspot.com/2020/08/a-workflow-for-dealing-with-dread-of.html).
