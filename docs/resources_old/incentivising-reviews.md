## Incentivising Reviews {#incentivising-reviews}

The peer review system can be conceptualized as a “gift economy,” i.e., a system where previously published authors repay their debt for the labor that other scholars acting as editors and reviewers have invested in their manuscripts by acting as reviewers for others ([Kaltenbrunner et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439211068798)). Despite this, it can be increasingly difficult to find reviewers for papers.

One way to incentivize reviews is to implement a way for authors to receive credit for the reviews they complete, and there are several ways to do this (see [EASE's guide to rewarding reviewers](https://ease.org.uk/rewarding-reviewers/)). One of the most widely known and used is [Publons](http://publons.com/) – a way to track an individual’s verified peer review history. [Reviewer Credits](https://www.reviewercredits.com/) is a similar initiative, except individuals can use their credits in a “Reward Center” to get actual rewards (ranging from discounted Article Processing Charges to online courses). Alternatively, reviewers can choose to [record their peer reviews on their ORCID profile](https://info.orcid.org/documentation/workflows/peer-review-workflow/). All of these require partnership with individual journals in order to be used by reviewers.
