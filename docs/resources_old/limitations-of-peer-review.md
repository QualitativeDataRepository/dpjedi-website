## Limitations of Peer Review {#limitations-of-peer-review}

It is important to acknowledge that peer review is an imperfect method for ensuring the credibility of published science. In fact, peer review became more popular after World War II partly for logistical reasons – as a means to manage increasing submissions ([Burnham, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1990.03440100023003)).

Although not a concrete piece of advice or "resource" as such, it can be important for journal editors to keep in mind debates surrounding the limitations of peer review. Some useful papers include: “Peer review: a flawed process at the heart of science and journals” ([Smith, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/)), “The limitations to our understanding of peer review” ([Tennant & Ross-Hellauer, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-020-00092-1)), “Is Peer Review a Good Idea?” ([Heesen & Bright, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/bjps/axz029)), and “Academic urban legends” ([Rekdal, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1177/0306312714535679)).

One specific concern is that peer review may not be reliable or consistent (even with multiple reviewers per paper). Two papers showing this are: “The reliability of peer review for manuscript and grant submissions: A cross-disciplinary investigation” ([Cicchetti, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X00065675)) and “Inconsistency in Conference Peer Review: Revisiting the 2014 NeurIPS Experiment” ([Cortes & Lawrence, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09774)). It is debated whether this is a “feature or a bug,” and whether it is possible to achieve reliable and consistent peer review. One potential solution is collaborative review, where groups of reviewers rate manuscripts on multiple dimensions and then gather to discuss and adjust their respective ratings. This model has been used successfully in the [repliCATS project](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/) (part of the [SCORE program](https://www.darpa.mil/program/systematizing-confidence-in-open-research-and-evidence)).

Others challenge the "thinking against" approach to peer review and suggest a reorganization to a "thinking with" model, or "[care review](https://allegralaboratory.net/who-cares-peer-review-at-allegra/)" as Allegra Lab puts it. Read about this idea in the Emergent Conversation series on “[Peer Review as Intellectual Accompaniment](https://polarjournal.org/2022/06/13/peer-review-as-intellectual-accompaniment/),” including the introduction article “[Beyond the Courtroom Model of Intellectual Exchange in Peer Review](https://polarjournal.org/2022/06/13/introduction-thinking-with-when-peer-reviewing/).” A supportive and collaborative peer review model like this can foster a communal rather than competitive/combative academic culture, which is important for increasing participation from historically excluded groups ([Murphy et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1921320117)).

Some believe there should be different norms for how papers can be written. For example, [Mastroianni & Ludwin-Peer (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/2uxwk) published a preprint summarizing multiple studies in a style considered unconventional by traditional standards. In their words: _"The paper you just read could never be published in a scientific journal... You're supposed to be very serious... You're supposed to pack your paper with pointless citations because reviewers might like your paper more if they see their name in it. And if reviewers don't like your paper, they'll reject it, and nobody will ever see it..."_

There are several schools of thought regarding how to improve scientific peer review. [Waltman et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v8ghj) proposed four: The Quality & Reproducibility school, the Democracy & Transparency school, the Equity & Inclusion school, and the Efficiency & Incentives school.
