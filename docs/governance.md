## Sponsorship and Hosting
JEDI is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation (awards 2032661 and 2332061), and organized by members of the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data‐PASS). [Data-PASS](http://www.data-pass.org/about){:target="_blank"} is a voluntary partnership of organizations created to archive, catalog, and preserve data used for social science research.

The five Data-PASS members currently taking the lead on organizing JEDI are:

- [Databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/){:target="_blank"}, at New York University and Pennsylvania State University
- The [Roper Center For Public Opinion Research](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Cornell University
- The [Institute for Quantitative Social Science (IQSS)](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Harvard University
- The [Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/){:target="_blank"} at the University of Michigan
- The [Qualitative Data Repository (QDR)](https://qdr.syr.edu/){:target="_blank"} at Syracuse University

JEDI is hosted by QDR. Hosting entails providing technical support, managing the resources required for JEDI’s operation, and moderating the mailing list.

## Shared Governance
JEDI policies will be decided by a group consisting of editors of seven social science journals, representatives from the repositories that currently organize JEDI, and the community manager (ex officio) who is engaged in active administration of the list.
