## Shared Governance

JEDI policies are decided by the JEDI Director, Associate Director, and Community Manager in conjunction with the JEDI Steering Committee, a group consisting of editors of seven social science journals and representatives from the repositories that currently organize JEDI.

### Team JEDI
