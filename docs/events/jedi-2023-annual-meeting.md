She has two lines of research. One examines people's self-knowledge of their personality and behaviour, and the other examines the individual and institutional practices and norms in science, and the degree to which these norms encourage or impede scientific self-correction. She co-founded the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS) and has been editor of several journals. She is the incoming Editor in Chief of *Psychological Science*. Simine will discuss the role of journals in encouraging post-publication critique and correction.
