## Persistence and Preservation {#persistence-preservation}

It is important to take steps towards the preservation of digital-only journals and other non-article-based digital scholarly outputs (e.g., interactive notebooks, video-based narratives, etc.). [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)'s Wayback Machine and [Clockss](https://clockss.org/) go some way towards this, but some digital-only journals are no longer findable even with these tools (see [Laakso et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/ASI.24460)). The persistence of "computational" articles is even more important to consider, as a lack of persistence can easily occur through technological obsolescence and/or neglect ([Pimentel et al., 2019](http://www.doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2019.00077); [Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416585)).
