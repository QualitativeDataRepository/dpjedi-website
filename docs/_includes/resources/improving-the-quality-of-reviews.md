## Improving the quality of reviews {#improving-the-quality-of-reviews}

Although academics are expected to peer-review articles as part of their job, they often receive little (or no) formal training for this. Early career researchers are often keen to be involved in reviewing papers, but without having had many (or any) of their own papers reviewed, they don’t know what a review should look like. Here are some how-to guides from different fields that editors can share with their reviewers in order to help increase the quality of the reviews they receive.

In addition to this, there are papers covering what _not_ to do as a reviewer, for example humiliate the authors ([Comer et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/17449642.2014.913341)) or be adversarial ([Cormode, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1145/1519103.1519122)).
