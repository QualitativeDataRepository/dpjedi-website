## Submission Types {#submission-types}

As well as traditional manuscript types (e.g., empirical articles, reviews and meta-analyses, and commentaries), several new innovative submission types are emerging. It may be worth considering which submission types make sense for your journal, and whether it would be useful to add a new one!

Some journals offer Datasets / Data Descriptors as their own submission type (akin to the type of manuscripts published in [*Nature Scientific Data*](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)). Journals offering this submission type will need to think through all the same decisions as they do when implementing a data and code availability policy for traditional articles (see our extensive section on this above), including ensuring data and code are hosted in a [trusted repository](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html).

[*Academy of Management Discoveries*](https://aom.org/research/journals/discoveries) has implemented “[Discoveries Through Prose](https://aom.org/events/event-detail/2024/01/19/higher-logic-calendar/discoveries_through_prose),” where authors are invited to present their empirical findings in prose rather than in more traditional “academese.” This can include (but is not limited to) continuous anecdotes or guiding examples, placing methods/thick descriptions in appendices, no traditional academic headings, and incorporating data/findings throughout. See [Kahn (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5465/amd.2021.0068) for an example manuscript of this type.

### Publishing Scientific Criticism {#publishing-scientific-criticism}

In this context, “scientific criticism” means a formal written response to a published finding. Journals can handle scientific criticism in different ways, e.g., publishing letters, commentaries, or online comments (post-publication peer review, PPPR). [Hardwicke et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/4w3kb) assessed PPPR policies and practices at journals and found that most journals don’t currently offer options for submitting PPPR, and those that do tend to impose strict length/timing limits. They also found that even at journals that do offer PPPR, very few PPPRs actually end up being published. Hardwicke and colleagues make several recommendations for journals that are interested in adopting PPPR in [Box 2 of their article](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/4w3kb).

### Replication studies {#replication-studies}

Many journals now have policies on publishing replication studies. Subscribing to the [“pottery barn rule”](https://thehardestscience.com/2012/09/27/a-pottery-barn-rule-for-scientific-journals){:target="_blank"} means that journals agree to publish a direct replication of any study previously published in their journal. Other journals go beyond this, to agree to publish a replication of any study published in a major journal. In order to ensure that replications are assessed on the quality of their design rather than their results, a replication policy can include results masked review and/or be only for Registered Reports (see above).

[*Royal Society Open Science*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos){:target="_blank"} offers a great example of a [replication policy](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies){:target="_blank"} that adopts the (extended) pottery barn rule, and offers two tracks for review (results masked or Registered Report). See this [blog post](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2018/10/reproducibility-meets-accountability/){:target="_blank"} introducing their policy.

[*The Institute for Replication*](https://i4replication.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} has a compilation of sample replication reports from various Economics and Political Science journals, replication instructions, and educational material on replication and open science that can be shared with authors.
