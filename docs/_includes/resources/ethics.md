## Ethics {#ethics}

The [Committee on Publication Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/){:target="_blank"} has many resources to help journal editors deal with ethical issues, including guidelines and case studies. For example, they have [guidelines on publication manipulation](https://publicationethics.org/files/Systematic_manipulation_of_the_publication_process.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The [Council of Science Editors](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/){:target="_blank"} has a [white paper on publication ethics](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/){:target="_blank"} including a guide to [editor roles and responsibilities](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/2-1-editor-roles-and-responsibilities/){:target="_blank"}.

Although some ethical issues are clearly defined (e.g. that authors should not fabricate data), there are other areas where there is debate surrounding the lines of editorial responsibility. For example, *[Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/){:target="_blank"}* has put in place a [new research ethics policy](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity){:target="_blank"} that addresses potential harms for human population groups who do not participate in research but may be harmed by its publication ([see the editorial introducing the policy here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2){:target="_blank"}). However, there have been some criticisms of the policy, suggesting that its vagueness could be open to abuse and stand in the way of “truth.” For one discussion on whether and how (identity- and ideological-based) diversity and scientific values should impact the research that gets conducted and published in psychology see [Conry-Murray & Silverstein (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/cskg2){:target="_blank"}.

### Editors publishing in their own journals {#editors-publishing-in-their-own-journals}

There is some controversy surrounding the question of whether editors should be allowed to publish in the journals that they edit. Where this is permitted, journals should have clear processes in place to evaluate articles submitted by editors to their own journals.

[Helgesson et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1449){:target="_blank"} conducted a systematic review of the prevalence of this practice. They found large variability of self-publishing across fields, journals, and editors, but ultimately that there are some situations where levels of self-publication are very high. This is corroborated by [Bishop (2020)](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2020/08/pepiops-prolific-editors-who-publish-in.html){:target="_blank"} who found that there are even some cases where the most prolific author in a journal is the editor-in-chief! In addition, among biomedical journals where few authors were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications, the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in over 60% of cases ([Scanff et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001525){:target="_blank"}).
