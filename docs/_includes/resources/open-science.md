## Open Science {#open-science}

A strong consensus is emerging in the social sciences and cognate disciplines that knowledge claims are more understandable and evaluable if scholars describe the research processes in which they engaged to generate them. Citing and showing the evidence on which claims rest (when this can be done within ethical and legal constraints), discussing the processes through which evidence was garnered, and explicating the analysis that produced the claims facilitate expression, interpretation, reproduction, and replication. The [Committee on Publication Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/){:target="_blank"} has a list of [principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/short-guide-ethical-editing-new-editors){:target="_blank"}.

[Nosek et al. (2015)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1422.full){:target="_blank"} presents an overview of the [Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines){:target="_blank"} for journals, which have been used to generate the journal-level [TOP Factor](https://topfactor.org/){:target="_blank"} and provide a clear view of areas in which editors can consider steps towards more open science at their journals. See this [summary table](https://osf.io/2cz65/){:target="_blank"} and example policy text for achieving a TOP level of [1](https://osf.io/t8f2k/){:target="_blank"}, [2](https://osf.io/7ebwk/){:target="_blank"}, or [3](https://osf.io/phbq9/){:target="_blank"} for different standards. For an example of how to explicitly signal adherence to TOP guidelines at your journal, see this example [policy](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/Cortex-TOP-author-guidelines.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [author checklist](https://osf.io/5stjg){:target="_blank"} from [*Cortex*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cortex){:target="_blank"}. You can even [contact the policy team](https://www.cos.io/contact-us){:target="_blank"} at the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} to talk through your journal’s specific needs with regards to editing your policies and practices in line with TOP Guidelines. A similar initiative is the [DA-RT Journal Editors’ Transparency Statement](https://www.dartstatement.org/2014-journal-editors-statement-jets){:target="_blank"} (JETS), a product of the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/About-APSA){:target="_blank"}’s 2010 [Data Access and Research Transparency initiative](https://www.dartstatement.org/about){:target="_blank"}.

### Open science badges {#open-science-badges}

One way of incentivizing open science is to offer open science badges to signal and reward when underlying data, materials, or preregistrations are available. Implementing badges is [associated with an increasing rate of data sharing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002456){:target="_blank"}, as seeing colleagues practice open science signals that new community norms have arrived. See the [guidance on badges](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/badges){:target="_blank"} by the [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io){:target="_blank"} for more information on how to implement badges at your journal. However, it is important to note that [receiving a badge for sharing data and code does not necessarily mean that analyses are reproducible](https://osf.io/srg57/){:target="_blank"}.

### Reporting guidelines {#reporting-guidelines}

Editors might consider suggesting or requiring that authors abide by discipline-specific reporting standards that include transparency requirements. For example, the [*American Psychological Association*](https://www.apa.org/){:target="_blank"} has a list of [Reporting Standards for Research in Psychology](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.63.9.839){:target="_blank"}. Specific reporting guidelines also exist for certain methodologies, e.g., the [Equator network](https://www.equator-network.org){:target="_blank"} has a list of [reporting guidelines for main study types in health research](https://www.equator-network.org/?post_type=eq_guidelines&eq_guidelines_study_design=systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses&eq_guidelines_clinical_specialty=0&eq_guidelines_report_section=0&s=+){:target="_blank"}, including the [PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/){:target="_blank"}.

You may consider adding requirements for specific article types in your submission guidelines, e.g., see the [examples from JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/instructions-for-authors){:target="_blank"}.

### Statistical guidelines {#statistical-guidelines}

One topic that editors might consider providing specific guidance on is statistics. [Hardwicke et al. (2022)](http://www.doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/q6ajt){:target="_blank"} found large gaps and inconsistent coverage in statistical guidance provided by top-ranked journals across scientific disciplines, and that the number of journals including statistical guidance for authors has changed little since the 90s ([Hardwicke & Goodman, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239598){:target="_blank"}). When creating statistical guidance, it is important to both consider what authors are being asked to report and how they are being asked to interpret statistics. [Fidler et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502008.x){:target="_blank"} found that even though instructing authors to provide confidence intervals in their papers increased this practice, authors very rarely used these to inform their discussion of the results. It is also important that editorial policies not selectively favor one side on controversies about statistical significance tests ([Mayo, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13861){:target="_blank"}).


### Resources for authors {#resources-for-authors}

Aczel et al. (2020) present a consensus-based [checklist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0772-6){:target="_blank"} to improve and document the transparency of research reports in social and behavioral research along with an [online application](http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/TransparencyChecklist/){:target="_blank"} that allows users to complete the checklist and generate a report that they can submit with their manuscript or post to a public repository.
