## Journal Management {#journal-management}


### Formatting {#formatting}

Formatting requirements need to balance saving the time and effort of authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers. Some journals choose to have specific guidelines that are most conducive to translating the articles to the journalâ€™s own formatting. Other journals have format-free submissions and make relevant changes later on when an article is accepted for publication. [The European Association of Science Editors](https://ease.org.uk/) has developed a [Quick-Check Table for Submissions](https://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2020.e53477) in an attempt to standardize instructions across journals and identify key submission requirements (this is available in several languages).


### Digital Preservation {#digital-preservation}

It is important to take steps towards the preservation of digital-only journals and other non-article-based digital scholarly outputs (e.g., interactive notebooks, video-based narratives, etc.). [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/)'s Wayback Machine and [Clockss](https://clockss.org/) go some way towards this, but some digital-only journals are no longer findable even with these tools (see [Laakso et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1002/ASI.24460)). The persistence of "computational" articles is even more important to consider, as a lack of persistence can easily occur through technological obsolescence and/or neglect ([Pimentel et al., 2019](http://www.doi.org/10.1109/MSR.2019.00077); [Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1145/3324884.3416585)).
