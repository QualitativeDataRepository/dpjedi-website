## Preregistration & Registered Reports {#preregistration-and-registered-reports}

Both preregistrations and registered reports are designed to help researchers specify a research plan before executing it. This improves the disctinction between *hypothesis-generating*  (exploratory) research and *hypothesis-testing* (confirmatory) research.

### Preregistration {#preregistration}

Preregistering research means specifying a research plan in advance of a study and submitting it to a registry. Preregistration separates hypothesis-generating (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. See the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"}’s [guide to preregistration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg){:target="_blank"} for more information. Journals can choose to encourage, reward, or require preregistration for confirmatory research.

There are several independent, institutional registries for preregistering research; for example, [ClinicalTrials](http://clinicaltrials.gov/){:target="_blank"}, [American Economic Association Randomised Control Trial Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Open Science Framework](http://openscienceframework.org/){:target="_blank"}, [EGAP Registry](https://egap.org/registry-0/){:target="_blank"}, and [The Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations](https://ridie.3ieimpact.org/){:target="_blank"}.

There are many templates available for preregistering different types of research. For example, the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} has [several options available here](https://osf.io/registries/osf/new?view_only=){:target="_blank"}, including more general templates and templates specific to social psychology, qualitative research, and secondary data. See [van den Akker et al. (2021)](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/3nbea/){:target="_blank"} for a systematic review preregistration template.

If you choose to encourage, reward, or require preregistration for confirmatory research at your journal, you can think about whether to suggest or require that authors use a specific registry or template for studies submitted to your journal.

### Registered Reports {#registered-reports}

[Registered Reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports){:target="_blank"} (RR) is a publishing format used by over 250 journals that emphasizes the importance of the research question and the quality of methodology by conducting peer review prior to data collection. High-quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication if the authors follow through with the registered methodology. This format is designed to reward best practices in adhering to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. It eliminates a variety of questionable research practices, including low statistical power, selective reporting of results, and publication bias, while allowing complete flexibility to report serendipitous findings. Although RRs are usually reserved for hypothesis-testing research, a version for exploratory research – [Exploratory Reports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217302393?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"} – is now also being offered.

RRs are a new and evolving format, and so many people are working to improve RRs for authors, reviewers, and editors. To read a summary of these conversations, or add to them, please see this [working document](https://bit.ly/RRsSIPS){:target="_blank"}.

### Resources for editors {#rr-resources-for-editors}

See the [resources for editors](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports){:target="_blank"} by the [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} for more information on implementing Registered Reports at your journal. More advice for reviewers and editors can be found in Box 2 and 3 of this [preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/43298/){:target="_blank"} by Chris Chambers and colleagues. For an example of an RR policy, see the [RR policy](http://cdn.elsevier.com/promis_misc/PROMIS%20pub_idt_CORTEX%20Guidelines_RR_29_04_2013.pdf){:target="_blank"} for [*Cortex*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cortex){:target="_blank"}.

### Resources for authors and reviewers {#rr-resources-for-authors-and-reviewers}

The [*Journal of Development Economics*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-development-economics){:target="_blank"} has developed a [website dedicated to guidance for authors and reviewers on Registered Reports](http://jde-preresultsreview.org/){:target="_blank"}. Eike Rinke and colleagues at the [*Journal of Experimental Political Science*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science){:target="_blank"} have also created a great [FAQ page](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/information/faqs-for-registered-reports){:target="_blank"} for authors.

### Peer Community In (PCI) Registered Reports {#peer-community-in-registered-reports}

[Peer Community In Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/){:target="_blank"} (PCI-RR) offers free and transparent pre- and post-study recommendations, managing the peer review of Registered Report preprints. The peer review is independent of journals but is endorsed by a growing list of journals that accept PCI-RR recommendations. Read [about PCI-RR](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/about){:target="_blank"} and see the [PCI-RR Journal Adopter FAQ](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/journal_adopter_faq){:target="_blank"} for more information.
