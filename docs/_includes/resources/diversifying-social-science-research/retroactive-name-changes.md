### Retroactive name changes {#retroactive-name-changes}

Although retroactive name changes may seem strangely placed in a section on diversity, the historical inability to retroactively change names in publications is likely to disproportionately impact marginalized individuals. Women are historically more likely than men to change their name after marriage and/or divorce. Although many authors who have changed their names after marriage or divorce have no problem authoring publications under different names, for others viewing their previous name will be traumatic (e.g., where a marriage ended because of domestic violence). In addition, transgender individuals often choose to change their names, and being referred to by their previous name ("deadnaming") can be traumatic for them.

This trauma can be avoided by implementing a name change policy. These policies can be implemented at the publisher level (e.g., see these from [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/network/societyleaders/publishing-strategy/new-author-name-change-policy-supports-a-more-inclusive-publishing-environment){:target="_blank"} and [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/inclusive-author-name-changes){:target="_blank"}), the society level (e.g., see these from the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/policy-author-name-changes){:target="_blank"} and the [American Chemical Society](https://axial.acs.org/2021/06/21/acs-publications-name-change-policy-advances-inclusion-in-scholarly-publishing/){:target="_blank"}), or the individual journal level.
