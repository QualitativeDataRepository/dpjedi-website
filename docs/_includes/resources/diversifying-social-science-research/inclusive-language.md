### Inclusive Language

There are several areas where editors may have an opportunity to encourage a more inclusive use of language when communicating about science ([Khan, 2021](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65604)).

For example, when discussing open peer review, one might use the term “masked” instead of “blind”; many journals have also adopted this change in wording. See this [American Psychological Association blog post](https://blog.apaonline.org/2020/02/20/an-end-to-blind-review/) for an explanation of why.

Similarly, “go-list” / “allow-list” / “green-list” and “stop-list” / “block-list” / “red-list” can be used instead of “white-list” and “black-list” when talking about predatory journals. See [Houghton (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2018.490) for an explanation of why.
