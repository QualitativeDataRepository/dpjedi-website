### Who is responsible for advancing diversity? {#who-is-responsible-for-advancing-diversity}

Research communities which adopt diversity as one of their goals should avoid over-burdening under-represented scholars with diversity-related tasks. Under-represented scholars are sometimes expected to play a disproportionate role in advancing diversity and inclusion in institutions ([Jimenez et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0911-5){:target="_blank"}, or read this [summary](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/04/whos-doing-heavy-lifting-terms-diversity-and-inclusion-work){:target="_blank"}). This may also be the case in journal editorial teams, and hence it is likely worthwhile to keep a note of who is advancing diversity and inclusion in your team to ensure a fair distribution of effort.
