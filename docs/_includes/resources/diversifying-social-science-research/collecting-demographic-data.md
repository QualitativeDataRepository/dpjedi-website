### Collecting demographic data {#collecting-demographic-data}

One step towards diversifying social science research is to have a better picture of who constitutes a journal’s authors, reviewers, and editors. Collecting demographic data may help efforts to increase diversity.

Editors at [*Personal Relationships*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14756811){:target="_blank"} have created a ["Diversity matrix” template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIzvUz97ThJVwuVZOqE8Ab3Mw4hD1_zA/edit){:target="_blank"} that can be used and adapted to collect data from authors, reviewers, editorial board members, editors, etc.

However, it is important to acknowledge that collecting demographic data may not be straightforward. For example, there may be geographical differences in how (and whether) to require authors to specify the demographic characteristics of their samples or themselves. For example, see [Jugert et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.2260){:target="_blank"} and [Juang et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15283488.2021.1932901){:target="_blank"} for discussions of these tensions within a European context.

#### Participants {#participants}

Some journals and/or societies choose to adopt a sociocultural policy in order to contextualize samples and study findings (see for example this [policy](https://www.srcd.org/news/new-sociocultural-policy-enacted-across-all-srcd-journals){:target="_blank"} from the [Society for Research in Child Development](https://www.srcd.org/){:target="_blank"}).

#### Authors, reviewers, and editors {#authors-reviewers-and-editors}

[*Proceedings of the Python in Science Conferences*](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/){:target="_blank"} undertook a survey of the demographics of their authors and reviewers; see blog posts summarizing their results from [2020](https://blog.neater-hut.com/scipy-proceedings-2020-survey.html){:target="_blank"} and [2021](https://blog.neater-hut.com/scipy-proceedings-2021-survey.html){:target="_blank"}.

This [blog post](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/22/why-the-who-of-peer-review-is-important/){:target="_blank"} summarizes the [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/){:target="_blank"}’s (AGU’s) efforts to increase diversity in their reviewers and editors.

Another way to encourage authors to reflect on and report demographic characteristics and how they may have affected the way they have approached their research is to require or offer the opportunity for authors to provide [positionality statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpcIVzGYhVs){:target="_blank"}. Positionality statements are statements made following the process of [reflexivity](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pchsiung/LAL/reflexivity){:target="_blank"}, whereby authors examine the “conceptual baggage” that they are bringing to the research. Positionality statements have many other benefits unrelated to diversity (beyond the scope of this resource).
