## Diversifying social science research {#diversifying-social-science-research}

An argument can be made that social science disciplines are characterized by different kinds of systemic inequality. For example, elitism is one source of inequality – [Kawa et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/aman.13158){:target="_blank"} found that the top 5 or so anthropology departments in the USA all hire each others' graduates. Another example is authors’ limited geographical distribution. Of the authors who published articles in the top five developmental psychology journals between 2006 and 2010, fewer than 3% were from countries in Central or South America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East ([Nielsen et al., 2017](https://doi-org.libezproxy2.syr.edu/10.1016/j.jecp.2017.04.017){:target="_blank"}). This limitation also extends to journal editors ([Altman & Cohen, 2021](http://www.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4nq97){:target="_blank"}). This is reflected in citation patterns too – [this article](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/08/27/entrenched-inequity-not-appropriately-citing-scholarship-women-and-people-color){:target="_blank"} points to the trend of inadequately citing or omitting scholarship by women and people of color and suggests some best practices journals can adopt to avoid this.

Some fields have developed local resources that could be adapted to other fields. For example, [Roberts et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620927709){:target="_blank"} examine racial inequality in psychological research to date and offer recommendations for editors and authors for working towards research that benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. [Buchanan et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6nk4x){:target="_blank"} also discuss strategies for upending racism in psychological science. In a different paper, [Buchanan et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zp9em){:target="_blank"} propose a Diversity Accountability Index for Journals (DAI-J) in order to increase awareness and establish accountability across psychology journals. The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/){:target="_blank"} provides a detailed [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Toolkit](https://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/equity-diversity-inclusion-toolkit){:target="_blank"} for Journal Editors.
