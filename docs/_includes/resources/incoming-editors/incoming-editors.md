## Incoming editors {#incoming-editors}

If you are just starting out as a journal editor, you might find the [Committee on Publication Ethics’](https://publicationethics.org/) short [guide to ethical editing for new editors](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/short-guide-ethical-editing-new-editors) helpful, as well as this [glossary of publishing and editing terms](https://www.pauldudenhefer.net/glossary-of-publishing-and-editing-terms).

The [PKP school](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/about/) also offers a [free course in becoming an editor](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/becoming-an-editor/), focusing on how to perform the major tasks required of an editor for a scholarly journal, how to analyze and solve common problems that may arise when editing a scholarly journal, how to assist other members of the journal team, and where to look for help with difficult issues.

The [Council of Science Editors](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/) has [sample correspondence for an editorial office](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/sample-correspondence-for-an-editorial-office/) that you can customize to suit your journal, and also offers [short courses in journal and manuscript editing](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/cse-short-course-descriptions/). The [European Association of Science Editors (EASE)](https://ease.org.uk/) offers training and webinars, a [Science Editors' Handbook](https://ease.org.uk/publications/science-editors-handbook/) and a [guide on how to select reviewers](https://ease.org.uk/communities/peer-review-committee/peer-review-toolkit/how-to-select-reviewers/). EASE also offers [Editorial School for Journal Editors](https://ease.org.uk/ease-events/training/editorial-school-for-journal-editors/), a four-week course on a range of topics relevant to editing.

The process of onboarding associate/action editors will vary hugely across journals. Most journals will provide at least some guidelines, whether written or otherwise (e.g., see this [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eTA2YkzqFc) for editors and reviewers at *Collabra: Psychology*). Journals may also offer opportunities for incoming editors to reassure themselves that they have comprehended these guidelines. [PCI Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/about) does this (see their [guide](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_177144648851613645297185) and [test](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoEQ3cfWdDmRixeq8oGUoTN-bVtcdOtriOVDveDMg3bULAeQ/viewform)), as well as *Collabra* (see their [editing training guide](https://docs.google​
