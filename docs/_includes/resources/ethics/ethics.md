## Ethics {#ethics}

The [Committee on Publication Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/){:target="_blank"} has many resources to help journal editors deal with ethical issues, including guidelines and case studies. For example, they have [guidelines on publication manipulation](https://publicationethics.org/files/Systematic_manipulation_of_the_publication_process.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The [Council of Science Editors](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/){:target="_blank"} has a [white paper on publication ethics](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/){:target="_blank"} including a guide to [editor roles and responsibilities](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/2-1-editor-roles-and-responsibilities/){:target="_blank"}.

Although some ethical issues are clearly defined (e.g. that authors should not fabricate data), there are other areas where there is debate surrounding the lines of editorial responsibility. For example, *[Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/){:target="_blank"}* has put in place a [new research ethics policy](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity){:target="_blank"} that addresses potential harms for human population groups who do not participate in research but may be harmed by its publication ([see the editorial introducing the policy here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2){:target="_blank"}). However, there have been some criticisms of the policy, suggesting that its vagueness could be open to abuse and stand in the way of “truth.” For one discussion on whether and how (identity- and ideological-based) diversity and scientific values should impact the research that gets conducted and published in psychology see [Conry-Murray & Silverstein (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/cskg2){:target="_blank"}.
