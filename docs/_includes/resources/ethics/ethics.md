### Ethics

The [Committee on Publication Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/) offers numerous resources to help journal editors address ethical issues, including guidelines and case studies. For example, they provide [guidelines on publication manipulation](https://publicationethics.org/files/Systematic_manipulation_of_the_publication_process.pdf).

The [Council of Science Editors](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/) has a [white paper on publication ethics](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/) that includes a guide to [editor roles and responsibilities](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/editorial-policies/white-paper-on-publication-ethics/2-1-editor-roles-and-responsibilities/).

Although some ethical issues are clearly defined (e.g., that authors should not fabricate data), there are other areas where debate surrounds the lines of editorial responsibility. For example, *[Nature Human Behavior](https://www.nature.com/nathumbehav/)* has implemented a [new research ethics policy](https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/ethics-and-biosecurity) that addresses potential harms to human population groups who do not participate in research but may be harmed by its publication ([see the editorial introducing the policy here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01443-2)). However, there have been criticisms of the policy, suggesting that its vagueness could be open to abuse and may stand in the way of “truth.” For a discussion on whether and how (identity- and ideological-based) diversity and scientific values should impact the research that gets conducted and published in psychology, see [Conry-Murray & Silverstein (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/cskg2).
