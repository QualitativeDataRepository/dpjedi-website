## Open Peer Review {#open-peer-review}

“Open review” means different things depending on what is open and to whom. Open review is a good example of a situation where the most open version may not be the fairest or best option, as there are many factors to take into account. It is also important to distinguish between open identities and open reviews (both of which, confusingly, can be called open reviewing). For an overview of the various definitions of Open Peer Review, see [Ross-Hellauer (2017)](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-588/v2){:target="_blank"}. For a review of the benefits and limitations of open peer review (some outlined below), see [Besançon et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-020-00094-z){:target="_blank"}. For guidelines on implementing open peer review, see [Ross-Hellauer and Görögh (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-019-0063-9){:target="_blank"}.

### Open identities {#open-identities}

Journals will have a policy on whether editors, reviewers, and authors know each other’s identities. [Transpose](https://transpose-publishing.github.io/#/){:target="_blank"} (TRANsparency in Scholarly Publishing for Open Scholarship Evolution) offers a database that includes information about which type of peer review different journals are currently using.

In **open reviewing** everyone knows the identity of everyone. This is argued to increase the accountability of the reviewer, giving less scope for biased or unjustified judgments. [Godlee et al. (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.21.2762){:target="_blank"} offers a good introduction into the benefits of making reviewers open.

In a **single-masked** system, only reviewers are made anonymous. This is to be as open as possible, while ensuring that reviewers are not treated unfairly (or fear being treated unfairly) for giving unfavorable reviews. Indeed, it has been found that reviewers are less likely to express criticism ([Mulligan et al., 2013](https://doi.org/10.1002/asi.22798){:target="_blank"}; [Ross-Hellauer et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189311){:target="_blank"}) and are less likely to recommend rejecting articles ([Bravo et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08250-2){:target="_blank"}; [Bruce et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-016-0631-5){:target="_blank"}; [Sambeek & Lakens, 2021](https://doi.org/10.15626/MP.2019.2289){:target="_blank"}; [Walsh et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.176.1.47){:target="_blank"}) if their identity is known to authors.

In a **double-masked** system, the editor knows the identities of reviewers and authors, reviewers and authors both know the identity of the editor, but authors and reviewers do not know the identity of each other. This is an attempt to eliminate personal biases of reviewers (e.g. those based on gender, seniority, reputation, and affiliation), e.g. see [Tomkins et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1707323114){:target="_blank"} for evidence of single-masked review being biased towards papers with famous authors and authors from high-prestige institutions. See [Nature’s editorial adopting an optionally double-masked system](https://www.nature.com/articles/518274b){:target="_blank"}. [Kern-Goldberger et.al. (2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35120887/){:target="_blank"} have conducted a systematic review on the impact of double-masked peer review on gender bias in scientific publishing, and studies seem to demonstrate mixed results. When given the choice, corresponding authors from less prestigious institutions are more likely to choose double-masked review ([McGillivray & De Ranieri, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41073-018-0049-z){:target="_blank"}).

In a **triple-masked** system, the identity of the editor, authors, and reviewers are all masked from each other. This acknowledges the possible personal biases of editors as well as reviewers. For some examples of triple-masked review in practice, see the guidelines for authors from [*Comparative Political Studies*](https://journals.sagepub.com/author-instructions/CPS){:target="_blank"} and [*Perspectives on Politics*](https://www.apsanet.org/perspectivessubmissions){:target="_blank"}.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but it is important to think carefully about which policy makes sense for your journal. If you choose a single-masked or double-masked system, you also need to think about what to do if authors choose to sign their reviews. Some journals remove these signatures, and some choose to allow authors to do this if they wish. If your field has a high percentage of desk rejections (e.g., Political Science: [Garand & Harman, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/S1049096521000573){:target="_blank"}) then you may wish to consider double-masked review as editor bias would have a bigger impact in your field.

### Open reviews {#open-reviews}

It is also possible to make the reviews themselves openly available alongside published manuscripts (with or without the reviewers being identified). This can help to give context to the published article. See this [blog post discussing the launch of open reviews](https://www.issi-society.org/blog/posts/2020/september/quantitative-science-studies-launches-transparent-peer-review-pilot/){:target="_blank"} at [*Quantitative Science Studies*](https://direct.mit.edu/qss){:target="_blank"}. [EASE](https://ease.org.uk/){:target="_blank"} provides a history of why some journals are making reviews open as well as a [guide on how reviewers can publish their own review reports](https://ease.org.uk/communities/peer-review-committee/peer-review-toolkit/how-to-publish-review-reports/){:target="_blank"}. The [Publish Your Reviews](https://asapbio.org/publishyourreviews){:target="_blank"} initiative encourages peer reviewers to publish their reviews alongside the preprint of an article.
