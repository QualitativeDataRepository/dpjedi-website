### Encouraging authors to acknowledge limitations {#encouraging-authors-to-acknowledge-limitations}

It is important that authors are transparent about and own the limitations of their work. [Hoekstra and Vazire (2020)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/edh2s){:target="_blank"} provide a set of recommendations on how to increase intellectual humility in research articles that can be used as both author and reviewer guidelines. In addition, editors who want to incentivize intellectual humility in their journals can implement policies that make it clear to authors and reviewers that owning the limitations of one’s research will be considered a prerequisite for publication, rather than a possible reason to reject a manuscript. For an example of a policy like this, see the [reviewing policies](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/management-and-organization-review/collections/reviewing-policies-collection){:target="_blank"} for [*Management and Organization Review*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17408784){:target="_blank"}.
