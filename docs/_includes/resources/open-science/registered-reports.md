### Registered Reports {#registered-reports}

[Registered Reports](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports){:target="_blank"} (RR) is a publishing format used by over 250 journals that emphasizes the importance of the research question and the quality of methodology by conducting peer review prior to data collection. High-quality protocols are then provisionally accepted for publication if the authors follow through with the registered methodology. This format is designed to reward best practices in adhering to the hypothetico-deductive model of the scientific method. It eliminates a variety of questionable research practices, including low statistical power, selective reporting of results, and publication bias, while allowing complete flexibility to report serendipitous findings. Although RRs are usually reserved for hypothesis-testing research, a version for exploratory research – [Exploratory Reports](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945217302393?via%3Dihub){:target="_blank"} – is now also being offered.

RRs are a new and evolving format, and so many people are working to improve RRs for authors, reviewers, and editors. To read a summary of these conversations, or add to them, please see this [working document](https://bit.ly/RRsSIPS){:target="_blank"}.

#### Resources for editors {#resources-for-editors}

See the [resources for editors](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/registered-reports){:target="_blank"} by the [Center for Open Science](http://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} for more information on implementing Registered Reports at your journal. More advice for reviewers and editors can be found in Box 2 and 3 of this [preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/43298/){:target="_blank"} by Chris Chambers and colleagues. For an example of an RR policy, see the [RR policy](http://cdn.elsevier.com/promis_misc/PROMIS%20pub_idt_CORTEX%20Guidelines_RR_29_04_2013.pdf){:target="_blank"} for [*Cortex*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cortex){:target="_blank"}.

#### Resources for authors and reviewers {#resources-for-authors-and-reviewers}

The [*Journal of Development Economics*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-development-economics){:target="_blank"} has developed a [website dedicated to guidance for authors and reviewers on Registered Reports](http://jde-preresultsreview.org/){:target="_blank"}. Eike Rinke and colleagues at the [*Journal of Experimental Political Science*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science){:target="_blank"} have also created a great [FAQ page](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-experimental-political-science/information/faqs-for-registered-reports){:target="_blank"} for authors.

#### PCI Registered Reports {#pci-registered-reports}

An exciting new initiative – [Peer Community In Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/){:target="_blank"} (PCI-RR) offers free and transparent pre- and post-study recommendations, managing the peer review of Registered Report preprints. The peer review is independent of journals but is endorsed by a growing list of journals that accept PCI-RR recommendations. Read [about PCI-RR](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/about){:target="_blank"} and see the [PCI-RR Journal Adopter FAQ](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/journal_adopter_faq){:target="_blank"} for more information.
