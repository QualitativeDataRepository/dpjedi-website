### Open data {#open-data}

Mandating or encouraging authors to share data alongside their manuscripts means that reviewers (and later, readers) can:

- See the structure of the data more clearly
- Run additional analyses
- Use the data to answer new questions

In addition, there may be a citation advantage for authors sharing data ([Colavizza et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416){:target="_blank"}).
