### Data and code {#data-and-code}

A set of stable core practices has begun to emerge with regard to data management and sharing. While all are readily available, some require more effort on the part of journals. For example, requiring authors to share data via a trusted digital repository (and not e.g. via a personal website) is easier than checking that the author's code runs. Iain Hrynaszkiewicz ([*Public Library of Science*](https://plos.org/){:target="_blank"}) has written a chapter outlining “[Publishers’ Responsibilities in Promoting Data Quality and Reproducibility](https://doi.org/10.1007/164_2019_290){:target="_blank"}” that describes practical approaches being taken by publishers to promote rigor and transparency in data practices.

Journals are increasingly adopting data and code availability policies. The [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org/){:target="_blank"} has developed a [Research Data Policy Framework](https://datascience.codata.org/article/10.5334/dsj-2020-005/){:target="_blank"} for all journals and publishers including template policy texts which can be implemented by journals in their Information for Authors and publishing workflows.

There are many repositories to choose from, and different repositories will have benefits for different fields and needs. For lists of recommended repositories, see for example: [section 2.2.1 in *F1000 Research*’s data guidelines](https://f1000research.com/for-authors/data-guidelines){:target="_blank"}; [Springer Nature’s list of social science repository examples](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/research-data-policy/repositories-socsci/12327116){:target="_blank"}; and [*PLOS One*’s recommended repositories](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/recommended-repositories){:target="_blank"}. Similarly, the [*Society for Social and Personality Psychology*](https://www.spsp.org/publications/guidelines-resources#4){:target="_blank"} has created a matrix of different trusted repositories and what they offer. Similarly, [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/browse/by-subject/){:target="_blank"} provides a database of different repositories and their attributes categorized by subject, content type, and country.

[Goodman et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003542){:target="_blank"} states that “A proper, trustworthy archive will: (1) assign an identifier such as a “handle” (hdl) or “digital object identifier” (doi) (see the [DOI handbook](https://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/6_Policies.html#6.5){:target="_blank"}); (2) require that you provide adequate documentation and metadata; and (3) manage the “care and feeding” of your data by employing good curation practices”. The [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/){:target="_blank"} have created [10 Things for Curating Reproducible and FAIR Research](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/cure-fair-wg/outcomes/10-things-curating-reproducible-and-fair-research){:target="_blank"} and [The CoreTrustSeal Trustworthy Data Repositories Requirements](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3638211){:target="_blank"}. See also the [FAIR Guiding Principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/){:target="_blank"} for data management and stewardship.

In some fields (e.g. economics), it is common practice to have on the editorial team a specific “data editor”. These data editors are responsible for creating, adapting, and implementing data and code sharing policies at their respective journals. Data editors often share important information that can be useful for other editors looking to adopt or adapt their existing data and code sharing policies. For example, the data editor websites for the [*American Economic Association*](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, [*The Review of Economic Studies*](https://restud.github.io/data-editor/){:target="_blank"}, and [*The Economic Journal*](https://ejdataeditor.github.io/){:target="_blank"} all offer a wealth of information and advice. See, for example, the [*American Economic Association*](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/){:target="_blank"} policy on [revisions of data and code deposits](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions){:target="_blank"} in the AEA data and code repository.
