### Reporting guidelines {#reporting-guidelines}

Editors might consider suggesting or requiring that authors abide by discipline-specific reporting standards that include transparency requirements. For example, the [*American Psychological Association*](https://www.apa.org/){:target="_blank"} has a list of [Reporting Standards for Research in Psychology](https://doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.63.9.839){:target="_blank"}. Specific reporting guidelines also exist for certain methodologies, e.g., the [Equator network](https://www.equator-network.org){:target="_blank"} has a list of [reporting guidelines for main study types in health research](https://www.equator-network.org/?post_type=eq_guidelines&eq_guidelines_study_design=systematic-reviews-and-meta-analyses&eq_guidelines_clinical_specialty=0&eq_guidelines_report_section=0&s=+){:target="_blank"}, including the [PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/prisma/){:target="_blank"}.

You may consider adding requirements for specific article types in your submission guidelines, e.g., see the [examples from JAMA](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/instructions-for-authors){:target="_blank"}.

#### Statistical guidelines {#statistical-guidelines}

One topic that editors might consider providing specific guidance on is statistics. [Hardwicke et al. (2022)](http://www.doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/q6ajt){:target="_blank"} found large gaps and inconsistent coverage in statistical guidance provided by top-ranked journals across scientific disciplines, and that the number of journals including statistical guidance for authors has changed little since the 90s ([Hardwicke & Goodman, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239598){:target="_blank"}). When creating statistical guidance, it is important to both consider what authors are being asked to report and how they are being asked to interpret statistics. [Fidler et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.01502008.x){:target="_blank"} found that even though instructing authors to provide confidence intervals in their papers increased this practice, authors very rarely used these to inform their discussion of the results. It is also important that editorial policies not selectively favor one side on controversies about statistical significance tests ([Mayo, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13861){:target="_blank"}).
