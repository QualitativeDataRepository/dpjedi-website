### Data ethics {#data-ethics}

It is important to note that there will be cases where data cannot be shared, and that it is important to be “as open as possible, as closed as necessary”. See [Meyer (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917747656){:target="_blank"} for an excellent guide on “ethical data sharing”. GREI (the NIH Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative) also has [a webinar series](https://datascience.nih.gov/grei-collaborative-webinar-series){:target="_blank"} on this topic.

[FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/){:target="_blank"} and [COPE](https://publicationethics.org/){:target="_blank"} have developed some recommendations for the handling of ethical concerns relating to the publication of research data. See their [blog post](https://www.force11.org/article/recommendations-handling-ethical-concerns-relating-publication-research-data){:target="_blank"} and the [recommendations](https://zenodo.org/record/5391293#.YYATD9bP0-Q){:target="_blank"} themselves here.

There may be particular types of data that are more difficult to share – e.g., data on sensitive topics. For a case study that includes challenges, tools, and future directions of sharing data in these cases, please see [Joel et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F2515245917744281){:target="_blank"}. For a case study that discusses the redaction of sensitive data, see [Casadevall et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00991-13){:target="_blank"}. Many repositories offer restricted access to data, e.g. the repositories organized in [Data-PASS](http://www.data-pass.org){:target="_blank"} (e.g. [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/){:target="_blank"}, [QDR](https://qdr.syr.edu/){:target="_blank"}, [Odum](https://odum.unc.edu/archive/){:target="_blank"}, [Databrary](https://nyu.databrary.org/){:target="_blank"}), and almost all repositories organized in [CESSDA](https://www.cessda.eu/){:target="_blank"}.
