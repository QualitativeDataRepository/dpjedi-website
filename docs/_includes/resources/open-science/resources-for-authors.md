Aczel et al. (2020) present a consensus-based [checklist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-019-0772-6) to improve and document the transparency of research reports in social and behavioral research along with an [online application](http://www.shinyapps.org/apps/TransparencyChecklist/) that allows users to complete the checklist and generate a report that they can submit with their manuscript or post to a public repository.
