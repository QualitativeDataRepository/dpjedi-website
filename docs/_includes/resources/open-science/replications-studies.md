### Replication studies {#replication-studies}

Many journals now have policies on publishing replication studies. Subscribing to the [“pottery barn rule”](https://thehardestscience.com/2012/09/27/a-pottery-barn-rule-for-scientific-journals){:target="_blank"} means that journals agree to publish a direct replication of any study previously published in their journal. Other journals go beyond this, to agree to publish a replication of any study published in a major journal. In order to ensure that replications are assessed on the quality of their design rather than their results, a replication policy can include results masked review and/or be only for Registered Reports (see above).

[*Royal Society Open Science*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos){:target="_blank"} offers a great example of a [replication policy](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies){:target="_blank"} that adopts the (extended) pottery barn rule, and offers two tracks for review (results masked or Registered Report). See this [blog post](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2018/10/reproducibility-meets-accountability/){:target="_blank"} introducing their policy.

[*The Institute for Replication*](https://i4replication.org/index.html){:target="_blank"} has a compilation of sample replication reports from various Economics and Political Science journals, replication instructions, and educational material on replication and open science that can be shared with authors.
