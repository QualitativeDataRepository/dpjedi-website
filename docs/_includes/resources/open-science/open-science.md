## Open science {#open-science}

A strong consensus is emerging in the social sciences and cognate disciplines that knowledge claims are more understandable and evaluable if scholars describe the research processes in which they engaged to generate them. Citing and showing the evidence on which claims rest (when this can be done within ethical and legal constraints), discussing the processes through which evidence was garnered, and explicating the analysis that produced the claims facilitate expression, interpretation, reproduction, and replication. The [Committee on Publication Ethics](https://publicationethics.org/){:target="_blank"} has a list of [principles of transparency and best practice in scholarly publishing](https://publicationethics.org/resources/guidelines-new/short-guide-ethical-editing-new-editors){:target="_blank"}.

[Nosek et al. (2015)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1422.full){:target="_blank"} presents an overview of the [Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/top-guidelines){:target="_blank"} for journals, which have been used to generate the journal-level [TOP Factor](https://topfactor.org/){:target="_blank"} and provide a clear view of areas in which editors can consider steps towards more open science at their journals. See this [summary table](https://osf.io/2cz65/){:target="_blank"} and example policy text for achieving a TOP level of [1](https://osf.io/t8f2k/){:target="_blank"}, [2](https://osf.io/7ebwk/){:target="_blank"}, or [3](https://osf.io/phbq9/){:target="_blank"} for different standards. For an example of how to explicitly signal adherence to TOP guidelines at your journal, see this example [policy](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/Cortex-TOP-author-guidelines.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [author checklist](https://osf.io/5stjg){:target="_blank"} from [*Cortex*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cortex){:target="_blank"}. You can even [contact the policy team](https://www.cos.io/contact-us){:target="_blank"} at the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} to talk through your journal’s specific needs with regards to editing your policies and practices in line with TOP Guidelines. A similar initiative is the [DA-RT Journal Editors’ Transparency Statement](https://www.dartstatement.org/2014-journal-editors-statement-jets){:target="_blank"} (JETS), a product of the [American Political Science Association](https://www.apsanet.org/ABOUT/About-APSA){:target="_blank"}’s 2010 [Data Access and Research Transparency initiative](https://www.dartstatement.org/about){:target="_blank"}.
