### Pre-publication verification of analyses {#pre-publication-verification-of-analyses}

Some journals have now adopted a policy whereby data and code are not only required for publication in the journal, but must be checked before publication to ensure that the analyses are reproducible – that the results in the manuscript match the results that are produced when someone who is not one of the authors re-runs the code on the data. This is called pre-publication “verification of analyses”, “data and code replication”, or “reproduction of analyses”. See [Willis & Stodden (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1162/99608f92.25982dcf){:target="_blank"} for a useful overview of how to leverage policies, workflows, and infrastructure to ensure computational reproducibility in publication.

For more information on how to implement a policy like this at your journal, see the [Data and Code Guidance by Data Editors](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/){:target="_blank"} developed by Lars Vilhuber and colleagues, which is used by the [American Economic Association journals](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals){:target="_blank"}, [Canadian Journal of Economics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15405982){:target="_blank"}, the [Review of Economic Studies](https://academic.oup.com/restud){:target="_blank"}, and the [Economic Journal](https://academic.oup.com/ej){:target="_blank"} as a reference. This [practical guide on training students to assess the reproducibility of articles in the social sciences](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/ldilab-manual/index.html){:target="_blank"} may also be of interest.

Several journals in political science also require pre-publication verification. See for example [State Politics & Policy Quarterly](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly/information/instructions-contributors){:target="_blank"}, [Political Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/information/instructions-contributors){:target="_blank"}, and the [American Journal of Political Science](https://ajps.org/){:target="_blank"}.
