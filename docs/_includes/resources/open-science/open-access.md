### Open access {#open-access}

Open access (making research outputs freely available to all) is important for disseminating and sharing scientific results with scientists and members of the public around the world. See [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html){:target="_blank"}’s [guide to open access](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-access.html){:target="_blank"} for an explanation of different versions of Open Access. Essentially, journals can publish open access articles in a hybrid model (where not all articles are open access, but some are), or be fully open access (where all articles are open access). Journals and publishers decide how to fund this – usually through charging authors for making their articles open access.

Although many journals are now open access from the outset, many journals that previously did not offer open access are making/have made the transition to some form of open access. For example, the editorial team from the journal *Lingua* [broke off from Elsevier](https://www.kaivonfintel.org/lingua-glossa/){:target="_blank"} and launched a fully open access journal: [*Glossa*](https://www.glossa-journal.org/){:target="_blank"}. Those interested in taking similar steps may wish to read about their journey; here are [some slides on the transition](https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=open_access_week){:target="_blank"}, a [blog post](https://www.rooryck.org/lingua-to-glossa){:target="_blank"} by one of the previous Executive Editors, and an [interview with one of the previous associate editors](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-mass-resignations-at-lingua/){:target="_blank"}.

#### Becoming an independent open access journal {#becoming-an-independent-open-access-journal}

The PCI (Peer Community In) [held a webinar in March of 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLgGSNq0Wk){:target="_blank"} outlining the current publishing landscape. It includes information on the ethics of different kinds of publishing models, including for-profit vs. non-profit journals, and different levels and models of open access publishing, which might be useful in thinking through some of the advantages and challenges of becoming an open access independent journal. SPARC also has a [website dedicated to helping journals declare independence](https://declaring-independence.org/){:target="_blank"}.

There are some outstanding examples of existing journals shifting from a commercial publisher or university press to an independent fully open access journal, or new independent fully open access journals being founded. See some of the below examples for inspiration! It is important to consider how/whether your journal will be able to be indexed, for example in Web of Science ([see here for their evaluation process and selection criteria](https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-workflow-solutions/web-of-science/core-collection/editorial-selection-process/editorial-selection-process/){:target="_blank"}). If this process involves transitioning to another publisher, [NISO has some guidelines](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/transfer){:target="_blank"} to ensure the transfer process occurs with minimum disruptions.

The editorial team from the journal *Lingua* [broke off from Elsevier](https://www.kaivonfintel.org/lingua-glossa/){:target="_blank"} and launched [*Glossa*](https://www.glossa-journal.org/){:target="_blank"}. Here are some [slides on the transition](https://scholarsarchive.library.albany.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=open_access_week){:target="_blank"}, a [blog post](https://www.rooryck.org/lingua-to-glossa){:target="_blank"} by one of the previous Executive Editors, and an [interview on the transition](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-mass-resignations-at-lingua/){:target="_blank"}.

The editorial team from the *Journal of Informetrics* also broke off from Elsevier and launched [*Quantitative Science Studies*](https://direct.mit.edu/qss){:target="_blank"}. See this [article about the transition](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/14/elsevier-journal-editors-resign-start-rival-open-access-journal){:target="_blank"}.

The [*Journal of Privacy and Confidentiality*](https://journalprivacyconfidentiality.org/index.php/jpc){:target="_blank"} made the shift to being an independent journal – see these 2018 editorials on their relaunch ([Vilhuber, 2018](https://doi.org/10.29012/jpc.706){:target="_blank"}) and future ([Dwork, 2018](https://doi.org/10.29012/jpc.708){:target="_blank"}). In the next phase, they are currently working on creating a non-profit organization that will house the journal.
