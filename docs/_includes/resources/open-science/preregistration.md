### Preregistration {#preregistration}

Preregistering research means specifying a research plan in advance of a study and submitting it to a registry. Preregistration separates hypothesis-generating (exploratory) from hypothesis-testing (confirmatory) research. See the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"}â€™s [guide to preregistration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg){:target="_blank"} for more information. Journals can choose to encourage, reward, or require preregistration for confirmatory research.

There are several independent, institutional registries for preregistering research; for example, [ClinicalTrials](http://clinicaltrials.gov/){:target="_blank"}, [American Economic Association Randomised Control Trial Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Open Science Framework](http://openscienceframework.org/){:target="_blank"}, [EGAP Registry](https://egap.org/registry-0/){:target="_blank"}, and [The Registry for International Development Impact Evaluations](https://ridie.3ieimpact.org/){:target="_blank"}.

There are many templates available for preregistering different types of research. For example, the [Center for Open Science](https://www.cos.io/){:target="_blank"} has [several options available here](https://osf.io/registries/osf/new?view_only=){:target="_blank"}, including more general templates and templates specific to social psychology, qualitative research, and secondary data. See [van den Akker et al. (2021)](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/3nbea/){:target="_blank"} for a systematic review preregistration template.

If you choose to encourage, reward, or require preregistration for confirmatory research at your journal, you can think about whether to suggest or require that authors use a specific registry or template for studies submitted to your journal.
