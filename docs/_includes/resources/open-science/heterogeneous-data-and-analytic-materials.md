### Heterogeneous data and analytic materials {#heterogeneous-data-and-analytic-materials}

While this section is framed in terms of numeric data and computer code, it is worth noting that cognate considerations arise in all circumstances where authors use a combination of data and analytic reasoning to make their findings. For example, authors can also make qualitative data and materials available for case studies that used process tracing analyses and relied on interviews and archival data.
