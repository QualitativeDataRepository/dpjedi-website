### Verification Reports {#verification-reports}

Verification Reports (VRs) are an article format focusing specifically on computational reproducibility and analytic robustness. VRs meet this objective by repeating the original analyses or reporting new analyses of original data. In doing so they provide the verifiers conducting the investigation with professional credit for evaluating one of the most fundamental forms of credibility: whether the claims in previous studies are justified by their own data. Chris Chambers has introduced this format at [*Cortex*](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/cortex){:target="_blank"} (see his introductory [editorial](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.04.020){:target="_blank"} and [materials for journals](https://osf.io/9g5d8/){:target="_blank"}). For examples of the first two VRs published by *Cortex*, see [Chalkia et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2020.03.031){:target="_blank"} and [Mirman et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2021.01.017){:target="_blank"}. If you’re interested in including VRs as an article type at your journal, Cortex’s [author guidelines](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/VR_GuideForAuthors.pdf){:target="_blank"} provide more information on this format.
