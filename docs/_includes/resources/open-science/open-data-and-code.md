### Open data and code {#open-data-and-code}

Mandating or encouraging authors to share both data and code alongside their manuscripts has all the above benefits of sharing either of these separately, but also means that reviewers (and later, readers) can check the computational reproducibility of the results (i.e., does running the code on the data produce the same results that are reported in the paper).

The [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/){:target="_blank"} provides helpful [guidance on implementation of their data and code availability policy](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/){:target="_blank"} that could easily be applied to other journals and fields. [The Berkeley Institute for Transparency in the Social Sciences](https://www.bitss.org/){:target="_blank"} offers a handy [guide on conducting reproducibility checks](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/){:target="_blank"}.

For a discussion of the impact of journal data policy strictness on the code re-execution rate (i.e., how likely the code is to run without errors) and a set of recommendations for code dissemination aimed at journals, see [Trisovic et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12793){:target="_blank"}.
