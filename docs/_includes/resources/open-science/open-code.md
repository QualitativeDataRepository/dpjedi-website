### Open code {#open-code}

Mandating or encouraging authors to share code alongside their manuscripts means that reviewers (and later, readers) can:

- See the analyses that were conducted more clearly
- Check whether the code runs on another (similarly structured) dataset

Authors can also give reviewers the opportunity to check basic code functionality by providing synthetic data. Dan Quintana has done a lot of work promoting the sharing of synthetic datasets and providing resources to help authors do so â€“ see his [YouTube video](https://bit.ly/3mjx088){:target="_blank"}, [blog post](https://www.dsquintana.blog/creating-and-synthetic-version-of-a-real-dataset/){:target="_blank"}, and [Quintana (2020)](http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53275){:target="_blank"}.
