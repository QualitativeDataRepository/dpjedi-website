## Peer Review Innovations {#peer-review-innovations}

Peer review is undergoing a sustained and multifaceted debate about different attempts to improve its perceived effectiveness, objectivity, transparency, and long-term sustainability. Many of these have already been discussed extensively above, e.g., deanonymizing reviews and/or reviewers, acknowledging and incentivizing reviewing, etc. There are many more â€“ for an analytical overview of ongoing peer review innovations, see [Kaltenbrunner et al. (2022)](http://www.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8hdxu). They categorize peer review innovations as either being about the *object* of peer review (what is being peer reviewed), the *aim* of peer review (why is peer review being performed), the *role* of peer review *actors* (who performs peer review), the *nature* of peer review (how is peer review performed), or the *openness/transparency* of peer review (what is available to whom during and after peer review).

One such innovation is the peer review of preprints. [ASAPbio has some resources](https://asapbio.org/recognizing-preprint-peer-review) on how we can improve recognition of preprint peer review. Another initiative involves groups focused on facilitating the collective peer review of preprints in the format of journal clubs (i.e., where several people discuss one manuscript). [The Preprint Club](https://www.preprintclub.com) is an example of this approach in the medical field, while [PREreview Preprint Journal Clubs](https://prereview.org/preprint-journal-clubs) covers a wider variety of areas. In the case of PREreview, the output is a "full PREreview," or a citable online document published on [PREreview.org](https://prereview.org/), which can even be integrated into a journal's peer review process.
