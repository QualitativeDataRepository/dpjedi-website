## Reviewer and Editorial Collusion {#reviewer-editorial-collusion}

Although hopefully very rare, there have been some reports of reviewer collusion and fraud. In some cases, authors set up fake accounts for suggested reviewers where they either [impersonate actual researchers](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/imposters-hijack-journals-peer-review-process-to-publish-substandard-papers/4013050.article) or create fictional academic characters in order to review their own papers (favorably, of course). In other cases, authors form “[collusion rings](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/6/252840-collusion-rings-threaten-the-integrity-of-computer-science-research/fulltext#FNA)” whereby they agree to suggest each other as reviewers and give favorable reviews to each other.

Sometimes the [editor is even in on this scheme](https://retractionwatch.com/2015/07/08/30-papers-flagged-because-editors-may-have-subverted-the-peer-review-process-with-fake-accounts/). This includes the phenomenon of paper mills ([see here for a blog post introduction](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2022/09/we-need-to-talk-about-editors.html)) – the process by which manufactured manuscripts are submitted to a journal for a fee on behalf of researchers with the purpose of providing an easy publication for them, or to offer authorship for sale.

Education of editors and reviewers to make them aware of these issues is the first step to tackling them. Publishers can also set up control systems that check for suspicious behavior such as private email addresses (although note that this is not foolproof as it will also flag innocent academics using non-institutional email addresses), as well as ensuring that papers always have at least one reviewer that has not been suggested by the authors themselves.
