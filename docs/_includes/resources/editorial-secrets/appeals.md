### Appeals {#appeals}

The opportunity for authors to appeal rejected manuscripts provides an important step in ensuring that high-quality and credible science is not incorrectly rejected from publication. However, there are considerable variations in appeal processes among journals, with little evidence of any detailed, reproducible, or established appeal policies in operation ([Dambha-Miller & Jones, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1002/leap.1107)). You may consider adopting a formal appeals policy that authors are made aware of so that it can be applied universally.
