### Cover Letters {#cover-letters}

How important is it to include a cover letter with a manuscript submission? It seems that [opinions differ](https://retractionwatch.com/2016/09/12/do-scientific-manuscripts-need-cover-letters/). [*Nature Immunology* considers cover letters](https://www.nature.com/articles/ni0208-107) to be “a dialog between the authors and the editors” where authors can “present their cases in a one- to two-page cover letter.” You may consider outlining in your submission guidelines what is expected in a cover letter, to ensure authors do not spend unnecessary time on a letter that is never read or, worse, have their manuscript rejected for not spending enough time on one.

If this corresponds well to what your journal expects from a cover letter, you may consider sharing it with authors in your submission guidelines.
