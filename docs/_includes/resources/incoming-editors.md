### Onboarding Associate Editors {#onboarding-associate-editors}

The process of onboarding associate/action editors will vary hugely across journals. Most journals will provide at least some guidelines, whether written or otherwise (e.g., see this [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eTA2YkzqFc){:target="_blank"} for editors and reviewers at *Collabra: Psychology*). Journals may also offer opportunities for incoming editors to reassure themselves that they have comprehended these guidelines. [PCI Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/about/about){:target="_blank"} does this (see their [guide](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/help/guide_for_recommenders#h_177144648851613645297185){:target="_blank"} and [test](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoEQ3cfWdDmRixeq8oGUoTN-bVtcdOtriOVDveDMg3bULAeQ/viewform){:target="_blank"}), as well as *Collabra* (see their [editing training guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zzEItmrMQpA3stKTL2X4Sl1XFCq6Qbi1uTYEwHb6-zE/edit#slide=id.g1acac551868_0_119){:target="_blank"} and the [associated test](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc73GmDVYXZOHCewcm17KA_IKNHaXmgK-LT29SEeUCoQjoJXA/viewform){:target="_blank"}).

### Publisher Guides {#publisher-guides}
