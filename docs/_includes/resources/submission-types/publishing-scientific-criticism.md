### Publishing Scientific Criticism {#publishing-scientific-criticism}

In this context, “scientific criticism” means a formal written response to a published finding. Journals can handle scientific criticism in different ways, e.g., publishing letters, commentaries, or online comments (post-publication peer review, PPPR). [Hardwicke et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/4w3kb) assessed PPPR policies and practices at journals and found that most journals don’t currently offer options for submitting PPPR, and those that do tend to impose strict length/timing limits. They also found that even at journals that do offer PPPR, very few PPPRs actually end up being published. Hardwicke and colleagues make several recommendations for journals that are interested in adopting PPPR in [Box 2 of their article](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/4w3kb).
