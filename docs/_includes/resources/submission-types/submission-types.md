## Submission Types {#submission-types}

As well as traditional manuscript types (e.g., empirical articles, reviews and meta-analyses, and commentaries), several new innovative submission types are emerging. It may be worth considering which submission types make sense for your journal, and whether it would be useful to add a new one!

Some journals offer Datasets / Data Descriptors as their own submission type (akin to the type of manuscripts published in [*Nature Scientific Data*](https://www.nature.com/sdata/)). Journals offering this submission type will need to think through all the same decisions as they do when implementing a data and code availability policy for traditional articles (see our extensive section on this above), including ensuring data and code are hosted in a [trusted repository](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html).

[*Academy of Management Discoveries*](https://aom.org/research/journals/discoveries) has implemented “[Discoveries Through Prose](https://aom.org/events/event-detail/2024/01/19/higher-logic-calendar/discoveries_through_prose),” where authors are invited to present their empirical findings in prose rather than in more traditional “academese.” This can include (but is not limited to) continuous anecdotes or guiding examples, placing methods/thick descriptions in appendices, no traditional academic headings, and incorporating data/findings throughout. See [Kahn (2021)](https://doi.org/10.5465/amd.2021.0068) for an example manuscript of this type.
