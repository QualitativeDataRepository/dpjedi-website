## Diversifying social science research {#diversifying-social-science-research}

An argument can be made that social science disciplines are characterized by different kinds of systemic inequality. For example, elitism is one source of inequality – [Kawa et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1111/aman.13158){:target="_blank"} found that the top 5 or so anthropology departments in the USA all hire each others' graduates. Another example is authors’ limited geographical distribution. Of the authors who published articles in the top five developmental psychology journals between 2006 and 2010, fewer than 3% were from countries in Central or South America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East ([Nielsen et al., 2017](https://doi-org.libezproxy2.syr.edu/10.1016/j.jecp.2017.04.017){:target="_blank"}). This limitation also extends to journal editors ([Altman & Cohen, 2021](http://www.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4nq97){:target="_blank"}). This is reflected in citation patterns too – [this article](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2021/08/27/entrenched-inequity-not-appropriately-citing-scholarship-women-and-people-color){:target="_blank"} points to the trend of inadequately citing or omitting scholarship by women and people of color and suggests some best practices journals can adopt to avoid this.

Some fields have developed local resources that could be adapted to other fields. For example, [Roberts et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620927709){:target="_blank"} examine racial inequality in psychological research to date and offer recommendations for editors and authors for working towards research that benefits from diversity in editing, writing, and participation. [Buchanan et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/6nk4x){:target="_blank"} also discuss strategies for upending racism in psychological science. In a different paper, [Buchanan et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/zp9em){:target="_blank"} propose a Diversity Accountability Index for Journals (DAI-J) in order to increase awareness and establish accountability across psychology journals. The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/){:target="_blank"} provides a detailed [Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Toolkit](https://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/equity-diversity-inclusion-toolkit){:target="_blank"} for Journal Editors.

### Inclusive language {#inclusive-language}

There are several areas where editors may have an opportunity to encourage a more inclusive use of language when communicating about science ([Khan, 2021](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.65604){:target="_blank"}).

For example, when discussing open peer review, one might use the term “masked” instead of “blind”; many journals have also adopted this change in wording. See this [American Psychological Association blog post](https://blog.apaonline.org/2020/02/20/an-end-to-blind-review/){:target="_blank"} for an explanation of why.

Similarly, “go-list” / “allow-list” / “green-list” and “stop-list” / “block-list” / “red-list” can be used instead of “white-list” and “black-list” when talking about predatory journals. See [Houghton (2018)](https://doi.org/10.5195/jmla.2018.490){:target="_blank"} for an explanation of why.

### Collecting demographic data {#collecting-demographic-data}

One step towards diversifying social science research is to have a better picture of who constitutes a journal’s authors, reviewers, and editors. Collecting demographic data may help efforts to increase diversity.

Editors at [*Personal Relationships*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14756811){:target="_blank"} have created a ["Diversity matrix” template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mIzvUz97ThJVwuVZOqE8Ab3Mw4hD1_zA/edit){:target="_blank"} that can be used and adapted to collect data from authors, reviewers, editorial board members, editors, etc.

However, it is important to acknowledge that collecting demographic data may not be straightforward. For example, there may be geographical differences in how (and whether) to require authors to specify the demographic characteristics of their samples or themselves. For example, see [Jugert et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1002/icd.2260){:target="_blank"} and [Juang et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15283488.2021.1932901){:target="_blank"} for discussions of these tensions within a European context.

#### Participants {#participants}

Some journals and/or societies choose to adopt a sociocultural policy in order to contextualize samples and study findings (see for example this [policy](https://www.srcd.org/news/new-sociocultural-policy-enacted-across-all-srcd-journals){:target="_blank"} from the [Society for Research in Child Development](https://www.srcd.org/){:target="_blank"}).

#### Authors, reviewers, and editors {#authors-reviewers-and-editors}

[*Proceedings of the Python in Science Conferences*](https://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/){:target="_blank"} undertook a survey of the demographics of their authors and reviewers; see blog posts summarizing their results from [2020](https://blog.neater-hut.com/scipy-proceedings-2020-survey.html){:target="_blank"} and [2021](https://blog.neater-hut.com/scipy-proceedings-2021-survey.html){:target="_blank"}.

This [blog post](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2021/09/22/why-the-who-of-peer-review-is-important/){:target="_blank"} summarizes the [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/){:target="_blank"}’s (AGU’s) efforts to increase diversity in their reviewers and editors.

Another way to encourage authors to reflect on and report demographic characteristics and how they may have affected the way they have approached their research is to require or offer the opportunity for authors to provide [positionality statements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpcIVzGYhVs){:target="_blank"}. Positionality statements are statements made following the process of [reflexivity](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~pchsiung/LAL/reflexivity){:target="_blank"}, whereby authors examine the “conceptual baggage” that they are bringing to the research. Positionality statements have many other benefits unrelated to diversity (beyond the scope of this resource).

### Who is responsible for advancing diversity? {#who-is-responsible-for-advancing-diversity}

Research communities which adopt diversity as one of their goals should avoid over-burdening under-represented scholars with diversity-related tasks. Under-represented scholars are sometimes expected to play a disproportionate role in advancing diversity and inclusion in institutions ([Jimenez et al., 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0911-5){:target="_blank"}, or read this [summary](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/06/04/whos-doing-heavy-lifting-terms-diversity-and-inclusion-work){:target="_blank"}). This may also be the case in journal editorial teams, and hence it is likely worthwhile to keep a note of who is advancing diversity and inclusion in your team to ensure a fair distribution of effort.

### English language editing {#english-language-editing}

If your journal publishes in English, you can consider offering an additional free editing service for manuscripts submitted by those for whom English is a second language. For example, see the [International Section guidelines](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/14756811/homepage/forauthors.html){:target="_blank"} at [*Personal Relationships*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14756811){:target="_blank"} and this article about [how the International Section is contributing to elevating international scholarship](https://view.publitas.com/iarr/rrn-printernationalscholarship-november2021/page/1){:target="_blank"}.

### Retroactive name changes {#retroactive-name-changes}

Although retroactive name changes may seem strangely placed in a section on diversity, the historical inability to retroactively change names in publications is likely to disproportionately impact marginalized individuals. Women are historically more likely than men to change their name after marriage and/or divorce. Although many authors who have changed their names after marriage or divorce have no problem authoring publications under different names, for others viewing their previous name will be traumatic (e.g., where a marriage ended because of domestic violence). In addition, transgender individuals often choose to change their names, and being referred to by their previous name ("deadnaming") can be traumatic for them.

This trauma can be avoided by implementing a name change policy. These policies can be implemented at the publisher level (e.g., see these from [Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/network/societyleaders/publishing-strategy/new-author-name-change-policy-supports-a-more-inclusive-publishing-environment){:target="_blank"} and [Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/inclusive-author-name-changes){:target="_blank"}), the society level (e.g., see these from the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/policy-author-name-changes){:target="_blank"} and the [American Chemical Society](https://axial.acs.org/2021/06/21/acs-publications-name-change-policy-advances-inclusion-in-scholarly-publishing/){:target="_blank"}), or the individual journal level.


### Considering citation disparities {#considering-citation-disparities}

Gender ([Chatterjee & Werner, 2021](http://www.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.14509){:target="_blank"}; [Dworkin et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-020-0658-y){:target="_blank"}; [Kozlowski et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113067119){:target="_blank"}) and racial ([Chakravartty et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1093/joc/jqy003){:target="_blank"}; [Kozlowski et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2113067119){:target="_blank"}) citation disparities have been found across a number of fields.

There have since been calls for more awareness, transparency, and communication about potential biases in citation practices (summarized in [Kwon, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00793-1){:target="_blank"}). Tools have been created to assess gender balance (e.g. [GBAT](https://jlsumner.shinyapps.io/syllabustool/){:target="_blank"}) and to diversify the race/ethnicity (e.g. this [Citation Audit Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HHM6i1WDaAVzSJxgZG8UtNWP3aRcFprsdVpLZJEWxOQ/edit#gid=759055580){:target="_blank"}) of the authors cited in bibliographies (although see [Syed (2022)](https://getsyeducated.blogspot.com/2022/07/youre-so-vain-you-prob​
