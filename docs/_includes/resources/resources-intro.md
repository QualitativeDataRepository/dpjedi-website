**Note:** we are thrilled to share [**A Guide for Social Science Journal Editors on Easing into Open Science**](https://osf.io/hstcx/){:target="_blank" title="A Guide for Social Science Journal Editors on Easing into Open Science"}, a curated collection of resources for journal editors on how to get started with implementing open science practices at their journal. This project was led by JEDI Associate Director (and previous Community Manager) Dr. Priya Silverstein with the help of many JEDI members and other scholars. The guide draws heavily from multiple sources, including this resources page. Please help spread the word on this wonderful resource, and thank you to everyone who contributed, either directly or through their excellent resource suggestions over the years.

JEDI members are jointly developing a collection of resources for journal editors in the social sciences. We are very grateful to JEDI members who have contributed resources for this page (see below for a list) and warmly welcome further suggestions. These can be made either by posting them to the mailing list, or by directly emailing Julia Bottesini at [jgbottes@syr.edu](mailto:jgbottes@syr.edu). Corresponding links will then be added to this page.

Please check back here from time to time, as we hope this page will be updated regularly!
