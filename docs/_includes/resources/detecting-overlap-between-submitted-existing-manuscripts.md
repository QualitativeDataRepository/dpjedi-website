## Detecting Overlap Between Submitted and Existing Manuscripts {#detecting-overlap-between-submitted-existing-manuscripts}

It can be useful to have tools and strategies to help your journal detect when a submitted manuscript violates your originality guidelines (e.g. a significant overlap with other work by the same author/s, self-plagiarism, or text recycling).

It is worth reaching out to your publisher to check whether they already offer any services to this end as part of the publishing platform and, if not, whether they would be willing to do so. For example, your journal (e.g. if you are with [Taylor & Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/)) may already have the option to opt to activate [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) in Manuscript Central, which produces a report showing the sources of any overlapping text. You can also opt to send manuscripts to [iThenticate](https://www.ithenticate.com/), which is integrated into [ScholarOne](https://clarivate.com/products/scientific-and-academic-research/research-publishing-solutions/scholarone/).

Sometimes authors will attempt to re-submit work that has already been rejected by your journal. [Editorial Manager](https://www.ariessys.com/solutions/editorial-manager/) runs a similarity check based on title, abstract, and authors â€“ this can flag these cases.

## Retraction {#retraction}

Dealing with articles that need to be corrected or retracted can be challenging. [Edlund et al., 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-022-03764-x) presents suggested best practices for handling retraction. [Ivory & Elson (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-023-05216-6) suggest a standardized approach based on the authors' roles, with examples.
