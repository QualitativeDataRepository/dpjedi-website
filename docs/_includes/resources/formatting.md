## Formatting {#formatting}

Formatting requirements need to balance saving the time and effort of authors, reviewers, editors, and publishers. Some journals choose to have specific guidelines that are most conducive to translating the articles to the journalâ€™s own formatting. Other journals have format-free submissions and make relevant changes later on when an article is accepted for publication. [The European Association of Science Editors](https://ease.org.uk/) has developed a [Quick-Check Table for Submissions](https://doi.org/10.3897/ese.2020.e53477) in an attempt to standardize instructions across journals and identify key submission requirements (this is available in several languages).
