- Incoming, current, and former journal editors (including managing and associate editors) and other editorial staff
- Representatives from data services and research infrastructure organizations, open science and metascience communities, and others whom the JEDI steering committee believes have experience and expertise that will be helpful in answering questions and addressing issues about transparency and open science in editing that are raised on the mailing list

If you believe you fit one or more of those categories, and accept the terms below, please [fill out this form]({{ site.baseurl }}/join){:target="_blank"} to join JEDI!s
